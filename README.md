Project Description
From Raw Data to Predictive Power: A Credit Score Analysis Project

This project is a complete data science journey, transforming a raw dataset into a powerful predictive tool. I started with a deep-dive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover the key factors influencing a customer's credit health.

Using interactive visualizations with Plotly, I brought the data to life, identifying clear relationships between financial behavior and credit scores.

The journey culminated in building a RandomForestClassifier model, trained to predict whether a customer's credit score is Good, Bad, or Poor. This project demonstrates a full pipeline, from data exploration and cleaning to building a highly accurate machine learning model.
